<title>Domingo Http Implementation</title>

<p>Http implementation of the contract in package <code>de.bea.domingo</code>.</p>

<p><b>Design goals</b><br/>
The connection to a Lotus Domino server is established via Http using XML.
The URL commands of Domino donot provide the full functionality of the
Java-API, but whatever is possible should be as easy to use as with the
proxy-implementation of Domingo. For each server, a client must establish
a seperate session, because different servers might require different
user credentials. Both, basic authentication and session-based authentication
should be supported.</p>
