<p>Implementations of some interfaces for temporary objects.
These implementations are usefull for tests or if only a non-persistent
instance implementation of an interface is needed, e.g. in adapters
between two modules.</p>
<p><b>ATTENTION:</b><br/>
Not all methods of the temporary implementations can be used, e.g.
<code>DDocument.getParentDatabase()</code> cannot return a
<code>DDatabase</code>, because the temporary document is not persistent.
Also maybe some other methods are note yet implemented because nobody
needed them so far.
