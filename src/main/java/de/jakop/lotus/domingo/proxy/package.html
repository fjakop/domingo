<title>Domingo Proxy Implementation</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Proxy implementation of the contract in package <code>de.jakop.lotus.domingo</code>.</p>

<p><b>Design goals</b><br/>
A Client should have only one session, shared between all threads.<br/>
A Server should optionaly have many sessions (one session for each thread)
for better performance.</p>

<p>A Notes Session could be shared between different threads, but objects
created with one session should never be used with objects created with
another session. This must be ensured on application level.</p>

<p>Sessions can be created via Corba or local call.</p>

<p>no recycle needed.</p>

<p><b>Multithreading issues</b><br/>
(from Notes Design Help)<br/>
You should avoid multithreading unless you have good reason to use it, such
as proceeding while file input/output and Web requests are processing.
Observe the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within a session, Domino Objects are shared, synchronized, and recycled
across threads. Using a different session on each thread loses these
capabilities; you must explicitly manage synchronization and recycle on a
per-thread basis.</li>
<li>Do not use DbDirectory across threads.</li>
<li>Accessing an existing document on multiple threads is permissible, but
accessing it on just one thread simplifies memory management. Restricting
accesses to one thread allows you to recycle without checking the other
threads. Creating documents across threads is always safe and these objects
 can be recycled without reference to the other threads.</li>
<li>Profile documents are cached on a per-thread basis. In the event of an
update contention, the last thread updating wins.</li>
<li>Take care not to delete a document needed for navigation by a view or
collection on another thread.</li>
<li>When child objects are used on threads other than the parent, keep the
parent thread alive until all child threads terminate. This is particularly
important when using Domino Objects in AWT event handlers.</li>
</ul>
