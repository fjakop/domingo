<title>API of Domingo</title>
</head>
<body>
Interfaces and factory for access to Lotus Notes databases.

<p>You can call the Domino Objects from a Java program by importing the
de.bea.domingo package. The program can be coded as an application, a Domino
agent or a servlet. Local calls access run-time code on the local
computer, which must have Domino installed. CORBA-based remote (IIOP) calls
access run-time code from a remote Domino server; in this case, the local
computer need not have Domino installed.</p>

<h3>Usage pattern</h3>
<pre>
import de.bea.domingo.DNotesFactory;
import de.bea.domingo.DSession;
import de.bea.domingo.DDatabase;

factory = DNotesFactory.getInstance();
session = factory.getSession();
database = session.getDatabase("", "log.nsf");
</pre>
<p>You don't have to recycle these objects as in the Notes API.
Instead Domingo about recycling all objects properly.</p>

<h3>How the Factory finds an implementation of the API</h3>
<p>The following strategy is used to find the implementation of the API:</p>
<ol>
<li>At first the system property <code>de.bea.domingo.factory</code> is checked.
If the property is available and contains non-empty string, it is interpreted
as the name of the factory class of the implementation of the API.</li>
<li>It is checked if the resource file
<code>de/bea/domingo/domingo.properties</code> exists and contains a non-empty
property named <code>de.bea.domingo.factory</code> to be used as the name of
the factory class</li>
<li>The default implementation is used with the factory class
<code>de.jakop.lotus.domingo.proxy.NotesProxyFactory</code>.</li>
</ol>
